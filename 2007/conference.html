        geared for those working specifically with children in Grades 1-6, plan
        to be challenged, changed, and cheered on as we interactively learn
        about God's design for our role as Kingdom influencers.

      <TD>
        There has been a holy frustration in youth ministry which is causing
        many leaders to thoroughly re-examine and reconstruct the youth
        program.  How deep does the reconstruction go?  To the Core.  This
        track is a must if this is where you are at.

        The church is full of volunteers, and we work with many of them; many
        of us are volunteers ourselves.  But do we intentionally develop our
        volunteers and lead them effectively?  What is the primary role of
        someone who leads volunteers anyway?  We will look at the Biblical
        foundation for equipping volunteers, and explore practical and
        spiritual ways to develop our volunteers and empower them to serve to
        their full potential.
      </TD>
      <TD><IMG SRC="presenters/gregGrunau.jpg" ALT=""></TD>

      </TH>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>
        Ministry is "under construction" these days in many churches as
        traditional models of ministry no longer appear to be working
        effectively.  Families are becoming more and more fragmented.  What can
        (should?) the church be doing in the midst of this fragmentation?  What
        does it mean to minister to the "whole body" &ndash; the family of
        families that comprise the church?  Explore various models and ideas
        through group interaction, brainstorming, and interview panels.  Bring
        your questions and ideas as we grapple together with the question:
        what does effective ministry to people of all ages look like in the
        21st century?
      </TD>
      <TD><IMG SRC="presenters/yvonneKern.jpg" ALT=""></TD>
