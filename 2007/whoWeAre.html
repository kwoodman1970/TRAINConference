  <H2>The History of TRAIN</H2>

  <H4>The Beginning of a Dream</H4>

  <P>
    It's hard to believe that TRAIN began way back in 1983.  It was birthed out
    of a small interdenominational group of Christian Education directors who
    met monthly for fellowship and professional support.  After a couple of
    hours of networking and a couple of cups of coffee, it was only a matter of
    time before they began to dream larger than their immediate meeting.  This
    group felt the need to invest in the larger Christian community and, after
    much deliberation, TRAIN came into being.  TRAIN 1983 began at First
    Alliance Church and, to God's glory, was attended by 250
    people&nbsp;&ndash; which exceeded everyone's expectations for a first-time
    event.  TRAIN has equipped, motivated and blessed many over the years in
    the braoder Christian community, mainly throughout southern Alberta.
  </P>

  <H4>Still Dreaming</H4>

  <P>
    TRAIN has an historical background worth honouring and remembering.  As the
    baton is passed on to new committe members, we hope we will be able to add
    another year of service as we continually look forward to encourage, train,
    provide purpose-filled resources and develop Christian workers and leaders.
  </P>

  <H4>Today</H4>

  <P>
    As a TRAIN participant, you will be experiencing the efforts of many hours
    of service&nbsp;&ndash; and we think you are worth it.  At the end of the
    weekend, we trust and pray that you will walk away encouraged in the Lord,
    having received something specific to take back to that place where you are
    the server.  Thank you for becoming part of the dream.
  </P>

  <P STYLE="text-align:center;">
    <I>At the heart of TRAIN there is a group of volunteers</I>
  </P>

  <H4>Moving Toward a Goal</H4>

  <P>
    On a monthly basis, a volunteer team meets to take on a particular TRAIN
    ministry description (or portfolio) so that the dream of having another
    TRAIN Conference becomes a reality.  It is a commitment to something larger
    than our immediate responsibilities and schedules.
  </P>

  <H4>Part of a Team</H4>

  <P>
    A significant aspect of TRAIN is the networking and the support we receive
    from each other.  Originally, the TRAIN committee grew out of a networking
    support group of individuals involved in various Christian Education
    ministries.  This is still a viable component of our monthly meetings as
    ideas are shared and friendships are developed.  That is how TRAIN began
   &nbsp;&ndash; from a group of people who had a desire to do something beyond
    themselves for the broader Christian Education community.  Together, every
    year, they commit themselves to the team.
  </P>

  <H4>An Invitation</H4>

  <P>
    Consider joining our team.  Serving on the TRAIN committee is an
    opportunity to serve&nbsp;&ndash; however, as in most serving
    opportunities, it is truly more blessed to give than receive.  You will
    walk away encouraged, challenged, rejuvenated, refreshed with more ideas
    and resources, and, most of all, new friends.
  </P>

  <DIV STYLE="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">
    A couple of hours per month.<BR>
    A weekend in the fall.<BR>
    A desire to serve.<BR>
    A passion to see others equipped to serve well.<BR>
    Most of all, a heart to trust God.<BR>
    That's all it takes!
