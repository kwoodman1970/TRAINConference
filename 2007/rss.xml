    2007 is a transitional year for the TRAIN Conference.  We have begun new
    relationships with a number of local Bible colleges.  We don't know for
    sure what future conferences will look like yet, but we're very excited
    about the possibilities -- TRAIN is under construction!  But What does this
    mean for 2007?  We're going to offer a somewhat more condensed conference
    this year.  The focus will be on children's and youth ministries, and
    we're also striving to bring back the Resource Centre.

    The first TRAIN Conference was held in 1983.  Every year since, as the
    baton is passed on to new committe members, we hope that we will be able to
    encourage, train, provide purpose-filled resources and develop Christian
    workers and leaders.  Contact us if you have any questions or comments, or
    if you are interested in volunteering with us in the future.  We are
    pleased to be partnering with a number of Bible colleges.
