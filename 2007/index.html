    TRAIN 2007 Conference&nbsp;&ndash;
    <SPAN CLASS="NoWrap">November 3</SPAN>
  </H1>

  <HR>

  <P>
    The TRAIN 2007 Conference is now
    <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:blink;">over</SPAN>.  We trust and pray that
    you found encouragement in the
    <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">Lord,</SPAN> and that you will
    continue to build up the body of Christ in your ministry area.
  </P>

  <HR>

  <A NAME="welcome"></A>
  <H2>Welcome to TRAIN 2007!</H2>

  <P>
    Here in Calgary these days, it is almost impossible to go anywhere without
    seeing signs of construction, road repairs, renovations.  Like our roads
    and new housing developments, TRAIN is in a transition stage.  Various
    factors have led us to realize that it is time to re-evaluate the way we've
    been doing the conference &ndash; to undergo renovations, if you will.  We
    strongly believe that God began a good work 24 years ago when TRAIN began,
    and that He will continue that good work of empowering and energizing
    today's Kingdom volunteers.
  </P>

  <P>
    For those of you who have attended TRAIN in the past, you will notice three
    major differences in the "renovations" to the conference:
  </P>

  <UL>
    <LI>the location has moved from Grace Baptist Church to Bethany Chapel</LI>
    <LI>the conference is one day, rather than a day and a half</LI>
    <LI>
      attendees choose one track to attend for the day, rather than picking and
      choosing from among several sessions
    </LI>
  </UL>

  <P>
    The day will begin with a joint worship session, led by a worship team from
    one of our local Bible colleges.  Three sessions, morning coffee break, a
    hot lunch, and a resource area round out the day.  Opportunities for
    networking with others in similar areas of ministry lend themselves to
    continued connections for encouragement and idea-sharing after TRAIN ends.
  </P>

  <P>
    We encourage you to look over this website, and make the decision to
    include TRAIN 2007 as part of your church's training and equipping ministry
    this fall.  Be sure to take advantage of the October 15th early bird
    registration discount!
  </P>

  <P>
    Partnering with you on the journey,

  <H2>TRAIN:  "Under Construction"</H2>

  <P>
    2007 is a transitional year for the TRAIN Conference.  We have begun new
    relationships with a number of local Bible colleges, and we hope that these
    partnerships will enable us to offer new seminars, new presenters, new
    material and new features so that you may be better encouraged and equipped
    than ever before.
  </P>

  <P>
    As with any relationship, though, it's going to take some time for us to
    get to know each other, to recognize our respective strengths, to learn to
    work with each other and to produce a vastly improved TRAIN Conference.  We
    don't know for sure what future conferences will look like yet, but we're
    very excited about the possibilities &ndash; TRAIN is under construction!
  </P>

  <P>
    So, what does this mean for 2007?  We've heard the voices of those of you
    who've told us how important &ndash; how vital &ndash; the TRAIN Conference
    is to you and your ministries.  Therefore, instead of temporarily closing
    our doors while renovations are under way, we're going to offer a somewhat
    more condensed conference this year.  The focus will be on children's and
    youth ministries, and we'll be providing practical, relevant seminars for
    those who are serving in those areas.  We're also striving to bring back
    the Resource Centre so that you'll be able to peruse curricula and
    reference materials.
  </P>

  <P>
    We're especially grateful to those of you who've encouraged us to continue
    serving and ministering to you all.  Hopefully, the dust will have settled
    by 2008 and the newly-constructed TRAIN Conference will bless your
    ministries in ways that have not yet been imagined &ndash; until that day,
    though, we thank you very much for your patience, support and prayers.

  <H3>RSS Feed</H3>

  <P>
    <A HREF="rss.xml"><IMG ID="RSS" SRC="rss.gif" ALT="RSS"></A> When you
    add the TRAIN Conference RSS feed to your favourite RSS reader, you will
    automatically be advised of new information as soon as it becomes
    available.

  <DIV STYLE="border:2px black dashed;padding-left:1em;padding-right:1em;">
    <P>
      <B>What's an RSS feed?</B>  An RSS feed is an update notification system
      for websites.  Suppose that there are 15 websites that you visit regularly
      to get useful information and you don't want to miss anything new.  If
      you use an RSS reader to subscribe to their RSS feeds then it will check
      those websites for you and tell you if there's anything new on them.
      <I>No more forgetting to visit a website!  No more needlessly checking
      pages to see if you've already read them!  No new information missed!</I>
    </P>

    <P>
      Most modern web browsers have built-in support for RSS (with differing
      degrees of usefulness) and will automatically detect a website's RSS feed.
      Look for this symbol:
      <A HREF="rss.xml"><IMG ID="RSSIcon" SRC="rssicon.gif" ALT="RSS Icon"></A>
    </P>

    <P>
      There are a variety of free and commercial RSS readers (including some
      that are web-based, some that work inside Microsoft Outlook and some that
      are standalone programs), and each one works a little bit differently.
      If you aren't using one yet then its wise to try out several to see which
      one works best for you.
