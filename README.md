# TRAIN Conference Websites
**Status:**  Ended<br />
*TRAIN Conference has ceased operating.*

## About This Project

The TRAIN Conference asked me to create their second-ever website for their 2001 conference (their first-ever website for their 2000 conference had been an unmitigated disaster), so I became a volunteer and used the opportunity to further my technical reportoire.

Each year, their graphic designer (chiefly responsible for designing print materials) would furnish me with their digital works and I'd incorporate them &ndash; including style and graphic elements &ndash; into the website.

These websites are the final versions for each year, published after each conference had ended.  I've made minor changes to them in order to showcase them in this portfolio (okay, I fixed a couple of typos, too!) but they are otherwise as they originally were.  **They're highly primitive in appearance and implementation by today's standards** (e.g. tables were initially used for layout), **but they complied with the standards &amp; best practices of the day and demonstrate how my skills improved &amp; my experience increased year after year.**  Many of the linked third-party websites have passed away over time.

### [2001 &ndash; Ex-stream Possibilities](2001)

This was my first TRAIN Conference website.  These are the design goals that I set for myself (I still aim for these goals today):

- Create something that's functional yet aesthetically pleasing
- Make it browser-agnostic (what's now called the [First Browser War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#First_browser_war_(1995%E2%80%932001)) was very much on my mind back then).
- Make it as lightweight as possible so that it would be useable even for those on dial-up connections

#### Noteable Features

- The main menu on the left is a single image with clickable hotspots.
- Tables are used for layout

### [2002 &ndash; Our Solid Rock in Shifting Times](2002)

This was my second website for them and is the forerunner for the later versions.  By this time, I'd had some time to contemplate improvements.  Their graphics designer had created new logos, too.

#### Noteable Features

- The menu on the left now consists of individual buttons that anmiate when the mouse is over them.
- The map for the venue appears in its own window.
- **NetConnect** *(not available in this portfolio)* was intended to create an online community by means of a set of discussion forums that attendees could participate in.  The concept predated social media by several years but would've been familiar to [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) denizens.  I used [WWWBoard from Matt's Script Archive](http://www.scriptarchive.com/wwwboard.html) (with some modifications to prevent HTML code injection) on the backend to implement this.
- Registration was still only by mail-in form, but organizations could now make online requests for brochures to distribute to their people.  I used [FormMail from Matt's Script Archive](http://www.scriptarchive.com/formmail.html) on the backend to send this information by e-mail to the appropriate committee member.

### [2003 &ndash; Daring to Dream](2003)

Other than a new colour scheme, not much changed between this year's website and last year's.

### [2004 &ndash; Triumph in the Trenches](2004)

By this time, web browsers had much broader support for [Cascading Style Sheets](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) so this year's website was a rebuild that embraced them wholeheartedly.

Furthermore, the TRAIN Conference were so impressed by my dedication and quality of work over the past few years that they asked me to be part of the committee.

#### Noteable Features

- The menu on the left doesn't scroll with the body any more (and I didn't use [frames](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-frames-suck-most-of-the-time/), either!).
- The menu buttons themselves were simplified by using a single common animated image for the background instead of two images (one animated, one not).
- Instead of a tiled background image, there's a non-scrolling single background image.
- There's an animated scrolling marquee at the bottom of each page.
- I stopped using tables for layout.
- The home page is encoded with some SEO information.
- It's printer-friendly.
- Online registration is now possible thanks to an 3rd-party event online registration service and payment processor (which is no longer available).
- Since the number of links to a page affect a page's rank in search engines, we began offering to link our website to attendees' organizations' websites.  We also began providing materials to help other websites link to ours.
- Social media was starting to become more prominent and people starting to get concerned about their personal privacy, so I did some research and came up wrote a privacy policy.

### [2005 &ndash; Stand Firm, Speak Boldly, Serve Faithfully](2005)

This website sports a new colour scheme (as usual) and a few enhancements over the previous year's.

This year, another organization scheduled a conference for the same weekend that we were scheduled for, so we tried to collaborate a bit with each other.

#### Noteable Features

- I created an RSS feed for SEO purposes, but anyone could subscribe to it to stay in the loop as information became available in the months leading up to the conference.
- I improved the user experiince by using buttons instead of links for pop-up forms (I was still using links for some pop-up windows, though).
- Badges at the bottom of each page proclaim &ndash; and confirm &ndash; standards-compliance.

### [2006 &ndash; Body Building](2006)

The website is becoming a mature &amp; stable product at this point and there were few technical improvements.

We pulled the plug on NetConnect because it never caught on.  I think, over its four-year lifespan, only one person ever posted anything in it &ndash; and that was one of the TRAIN Conference committee members.

#### Noteable Features

- Buttons are now used for all pop-up windows so that the user experience is consistent.

### [2007 &ndash; Under Construction](2007)

Again, there were few technical improvements compared to the previous year's website.

This was TRAIN Conference's the final year.

#### Noteable Features

- CSS initial caps for first paragraphs are implemented.
- There was a lot of buzz about RSS feeds at the time, so buttons were placed on the home page to make it easy for people to add the TRAIN Conference's feed to their online aggregators.

## Technologies Used

Some of these programs are obsolete now and I use newer programs to perform the same tasks.

- [Crimson Editor](http://crimsoneditor.com/) for HTML, CSS, JavaScript &amp; Perl development
- Microsoft Paint for making some of the images
- [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/) for cropping, resizing, compacting and converting image files
- [TurboCAD V3 for Windows](https://winworldpc.com/product/turbocad/3x) for making the individual frames of the animated "NEW!" sunburst image
- [Microsoft GIF Animator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_GIF_Animator) for making... well, the name says it all, doesn't it?

## TODO:

- Put pages for NetConnect in the relevent websites so visitors have *some* idea of what it looked like.

## About TRAIN Conference

TRAIN Conference started in 1983 after a group of interdenominational Christian Education directors (who'd been meeting monthly for coffee, fellowship &amp; support) determined that their respective teams of volunteers would benefit from the same training.  After some deliberation, the first TRAIN Conference was held in November of 1983 with 250 attendees &ndash; exceeding everyone's expectations.

TRAIN Conferences were held annually on the first weekend of November for many years after that.  The goal had always been to provide high-quality, informative seminars at affordable rates, so it ran as an (unregistered) non-profit with volunteers.  As the new millenium was starting and the Internet was becoming more available to home users, other conferences (which operated more like businesses) began to emerge and saturate the market.  TRAIN Conference couldn't compete with their larger budgets and couldn't attract the same attendance as it used to.  The writing was on the wall even before the 2007 conference had started, so the decision was made to bring things to a conclusion shortly thereafter.
