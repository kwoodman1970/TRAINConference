      <H2>The History of TRAIN</H2>

      <H4>The Beginning of a Dream</H4>

      <P>
        It's hard to believe that TRAIN began way back in 1983.  It was birthed
        out of a small interdenominational group of Christian Education
        directors who met monthly for fellowship and professional support.
        After a couple of hours of networking and a couple of cups of coffee,
        it was only a matter of time before they began to dream larger than
        their immediate meeting.  This group felt the need to invest in the
        larger Christian community and, after much deliberation, TRAIN came
        into being.  TRAIN 1983 began at First Alliance Church and, to God's
        glory, was attended by 250 people &#8211; which exceeded everyone's
        expectations for a first-time event.  TRAIN has equipped, motivated and
        blessed many over the years in the braoder Christian community, mainly
        throughout southern Alberta.
      </P>

      <H4>Still Dreaming</H4>

      <P>
        TRAIN has an historical backbone worth honouring and remembering.  As
        the baton is passed on to new committe members, we hope we will be able
        to add another year of service as we continually look forward to
        encourage, train, provide purpose-filled resources and develop church
        workers and leaders.
      </P>

      <H4>Today</H4>

      <P>
        Today you are experiencing the efforts of many hours of service &#8211;
        and we think you are worth it.  At the end of the weekend, we trust and
        pray that you will walk away encouraged in the Lord, having received
        something specific to take back to that place where you are the server.
        Thank you for becoming part of the story.
      </P>

        <I>At the heart of TRAIN there is a group of volunteers</I>
      </P>

      <H4>Moving Toward a Goal</H4>

      <P>
        On a monthly basis, a volunteer team meets to take on a particular
        TRAIN ministry description (or portfolio) so that the dream of having
        another TRAIN Conference becomes a reality.  It is a commitment to
        something larger than our immediate responsibilities and schedules.
      </P>

      <H4>Part of a Team</H4>

      <P>
        A significant aspect of TRAIN is the networking and the support we
        receive from each other.  Originally, the TRAIN committee grew out of a
        networking support group of individuals involved in various Christian
        Education ministries.  This is still a viable component of our monthly
        meetings as ideas are shared and friendships are developed.  That is
        how TRAIN began &#8211; from a group of people who had a desire to do
        something beyond themselves for the broader Christian Education
        community.  Together, every year, they commit themselves to the team.
      </P>

      <H4>An Invitation</H4>

      <P>
        Consider joining our team.  Serving on the TRAIN committee is an
        opportunity to serve &#8211; however, as in most serving opportunities,
        it is truly more blessed to give than receive.  You will walk away
        encouraged, challenged, rejuvenated, refreshed with more ideas and
        resources, and, most of all, new friends.
      </P>
