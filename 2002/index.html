      <P>
        <B>Change</B>.  The word conjures up feelings of discomfort and even
        fear, because we tend to like the comfort of familiarity and security
        in our lives.  Like no other time in recent history, September 11, 2001
        has etched itself into our hearts as a point in time after which things
        would never be the same.  It forever changed people's perspectives on
        personal and eternal security as they grasped for stability and answers
        in a world turned upside down.
      </P>
        
      <P>
        <B>We have a God who remains our solid rock in the midst of shifting
        times</B>.  He does not change, even though the pace of change in the
        world around us seems to be increasing every day.  The message of hope
        and salvation through Jesus Christ remains constantly relevant, even
        though the way we do ministry must continue to change to remain
        culturally relevant.
      </P>

      <P>
        <B>TRAIN 2002 invites you to join us as we focus on being God's change
        agents</B> in whatever ministry &#8211; adults, youth, children,
        leadership, etc. &#8211; to which He has called us.  You will be given
        tools and resources to serve effectively in changing ministries, learn
        from and interact with seasoned leaders and colleagues in the trenches,
        be challenged with new ideas, and be refreshed by the powerful truth
        that we can hold fast to our Solid Rock, no matter what circumstances
        come our way.
