        The TRAIN 2001 conference is now over.  We trust and pray that you 
        found encouragement in the Lord, having received something specific to
        take back to that place where you are the server, and we look forward
        to doing more for you in 2002.
      </P>

        <A HREF="mailto:traincalgary@hotmail.com">Consider joining our
        team.</A>  Serving on the TRAIN committee is an opportunity to serve --
        however, as in most serving opportunities, it is truly more blessed to
        give than receive.  You will walk away encouraged, challenged,
        rejuvenated, refreshed with more ideas and resources, and, most of all,
        new friends.
