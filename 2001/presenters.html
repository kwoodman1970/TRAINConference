              An award winning author and speaker, Phil Callaway is known
              worldwide for his humourous yet perceptive look at the Christian
              life.  He is the best-selling author of six books, including <I>I
              Used to Have Answers -- Now I Have Kids</I>, <I>Making Life Rich
              Without Any Money</I>, <I>Honey, I Dunked the Kids</I>, and
              <I>Who Put the Skunk in the Trunk?</I>
            </P>

            <P>
              Callaway is editor of Prairie Bible Institute's <I>Servant</I>              magazine, which he started in 1988 with the goal of encouraging,
              edifying and educating Christians. One of Phil's greatest joys is
              helping others laugh and learn about the things that matter most.

            <P>              <I>"The only thing better than Phil's humour is his honesty.              Phil is, quite possibly, the funniest Canadian alive."</I> --              Martha Bolton, Bob Hope's joke writer
